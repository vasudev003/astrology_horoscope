Palm Reading: The Intuitive Science
</h2>
<p>
If practiced in a rational manner, <a href="">
Palm Reading</a> helps one in setting foot on the right path of life. It provides
relevant information about important aspects of life like health, career, marriage
and love, which is why it can be said that your hands hold the key to the luck and
reveals information about important realms of your life. The colour, shape and lines
present in one’s palm is keenly observed to navigate the results. The length of
the fingers are also taken into account to retrieve crucial information about a
human being’s past, present and future. In various places, the spiral imprints of
the fingers are also observed within the domain of Palmistry.
</p>
<h2>
Palmistry in Vedic Astrology</h2>
<p>
Palmistry is known as Hasta Samudrika Shastra and considered an innate part of <a href="">Vedic Astrology</a>. If Palm Reading
is conducted from a Vedic point of view, an individual can introspect his/her life
in a better fashion. The hands are given the status of a determiner, which helps
us in forming our lives. It is also believed that various planets are situated in
various areas of one’s palm.
</p>
<p>
After an observation is conducted on the signs formed on them, a person can attain
knowledge about his turbulent and prosperous times. Life line, heart line, mind
line, fate line and marriage line are predominantly found on an individual’s palm
which produces information about the concerned fields. Information about the health
of an individual can be attained by analysing the health line present on their palm.
Also, what physical discomforts and ailments might occur to him/her can also be
known with the assistance of Palmistry. Similar information is produced about the
respective aspects of marriage, fate, heart, life and mind by analysing the concerned
lines associated with them. However, there are certain exceptions, as some of these
lines are not present on the palms of certain human beings. Thus, one’s hand is
quite an important aspect, which can help one figure out intricate details about
his/her respective lives.

<b>Palm Lines &amp; What They Reveal</b></a></p>
<h2>
Which Hand To See For Palm Reading?
</h2>
<p>
According to Vedic Astrology, the dominant hand of an individual i.e, the hand which
is used to perform all the necessary tasks, is taken into consideration for Hand
Reading. The passive hand of an individual is also assessed to take note of his/her
inherited characteristics and calibre. With the aid of the dominant hand, a person
can manage to evaluate his/her future without consulting any palmist. AstroSage
has provided some necessary information on how to practise the art of Palmistry.
Let us take a look at the usage of Palmistry for the prediction of one’s falls and
fortunes.</p>
<h2>
Types of Palms
</h2> 
<p>
There are four types of hands representing four different elements. Lines of dominant
and passive hands tend to be different. Following are different types of hands which
are seen during Hand Reading:
</p>
<p>
<img align="left" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5Fddeahxh8ahDNnysKIFo7tqswng9ZtnFK3wyvyPf1bz7dYcHmiOjjeOSQWHydRSXXorE_lF-C3iKFs5D1Qbug-mrSbsEByBLJbB1mtf-IWuDAP2Dd00nV7rNcbtdEnKdfCN2boo" width="401" height="300" alt=''/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Air Hands:</b> These kinds of hands are identified as a square-shaped palm with
thin and clear lines and long fingers. People with these kinds of hands tend to
be sociable and smart in nature. Also, they can be a bit restless and crave changes
often. They love mental stimulation and look for a close and harmonious relationship
with mental stability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Earth Hands:</b> These kinds of hands are identified as a square-shaped palm
with deep, thick and clear lines and short fingers. Natives with such hands tend
to be practical in life and down-to-earth. They connect strongly with nature and
can be straightforward as lovers.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b> Fire Hands:</b> These kinds of hands are identified as a long palm with abundant
lines and short fingers. The natives with such hands have a warm and firm skin and
are known to be risk-takers. In their love life, they are known to be the leaders
and can be loving and positive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Water Hands:</b> These kinds of hands are identified as a long palm with thin
and unclear, plentiful lines and long fingers. Their skin can be soft, and the natives
can be emotional and creative. In their love life, these natives tend to be sensitive,
caring and a little naive.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
The Art Of Palm Reading To Predict One’s Life</h2>
<p>
Out of all the lines present in your palm, four major lines are predominantly studied
to predict one’s future. They are the Heart, Fate, Life and Head lines respectively.
Other than that, we have several other lines which tell about one’s marital life,
children, profession, fame and much more. Let’s read some:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The Heart Line determines the aspect of love. If this particular line begins from
your index finger, then you will be lucky in love. You will become selfish in love
if it begins from your middle finger. Also, you are likely to remain head over heels
in love if the line starts between your index and middle finger.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Head Line provides information about your intellect and wisdom. If the line
is curvy, you will have creative abilities and a spontaneous nature. A straighter
line indicates your practical attitude towards the aspect of learning.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The journey you choose to embark upon in life can be predicted by studying the Life
Line, which starts in between your index finger and thumb. If the line is straight
forward, your journey will be a smooth one. On the contrary, a crooked line points
out your low life expectancy and hurdles that you will encounter in the path of
life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Next on the list is the Fate Line. Not each and every human being has this line
engraved on their palms. The deep nature of this line suggests your dependency on
destiny while its broken and shallow nature reveals the altering nature of your
life.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Fame Line indicates wealth, reputation in society and talent and runs parallel
along the fate line. It is very rare for the palmist to see this line on a native’s
palm.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In case you wish to know more about your marital life and bliss, <a href="">
Marriage Lines</a> are there to reveal it all. These are short in length and
present horizontally underneath the little finger on the side. Multiple lines suggest
multiple relationships, a fragmented line suggests troubled relationship, a forked
one reveals separation whereas a deep line indicates strong and lasting relations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Vertical Lines revealing about Kids are present right beneath the little finger.
These lines develop through Love or Marriage Lines. Apart from your own children,
they can be grandchildren, adopted children, nieces, neighbor's child with whom
you’re connected etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Intuition Line runs parallel to the Life Line, as it is an indication of deep insight
on life. If it appears to be prominent, deeper and longer, than the native tends
to possess a psychic ability. It isn’t that easy to detect this line and can be
entirely absent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
With Health Line, one gets to know about his/her health along with finances. One’s
health and money goes hand in hand. It can be traced vertically below the ring finger.
Breaks on that line indicate monetary losses, circles suggest surgeries and hospital
stays, criss-crosses tell about possible accidents, forked line tells about chronic
diseases and jagged one suggest multiple health troubles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These basic information with regards to Palmistry can help you mould your life in
a better way. Information about your married life also can be accessed with the
help of Palmistry and you can find out your compatibility with your spouse. But
it should be kept in mind that it is not necessary to become adherent to keep reading
your palms in order to assess your character and future. Palmistry has characteristics
which are quite evaporative as it has the capacity to get altered by many factors.
